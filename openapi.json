    "description": "# Introduction\n\nThe Syntage API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer).\nOur API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.\n\n# Environments\n\n| Name | Description | Base URL |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| **Sandbox** | The Sandbox environment is dedicated to development and testing. In this environment, no real taxpayer credentials are required and all interaction with the SAT is simulated generating life-like data, allowing you to pull test data from all endpoints. | https://api.sandbox.syntage.com |\n| **Production** | The Production environment is dedicated to live applications with real connections to the SAT. In this environment, real taxpayer credentials are required, and you will pull real fiscal data directly from the SAT. | https://api.syntage.com |\n\nEach environment has a different API Key for [authentication](#section/Authentication).\n\n# Request IDs\n\nEach API request has an associated request identifier.\nYou can find this value in the response headers, under `X-Request-ID`:\n\n```curl\ncurl -i https://api.syntage.com\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Sun, 29 Nov 2020 19:21:21 GMT\nX-Request-ID: Root=1-6532dcae-169bf139354cd48959f55c55\n```\n\nIf you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.\n\n# Rate Limiting\n\nOur API employs a number of safeguards against bursts of incoming traffic to help maximize its stability.\nThe returned HTTP headers of any API request show your current rate limit status:\n\n```curl\ncurl -i https://api.syntage.com\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Sun, 29 Nov 2020 19:21:21 GMT\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 60\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 56\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1606678044\n```\n\n| Header Name           | Description |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| X-RateLimit-Limit     | The maximum number of requests you're permitted to make.                     |\n| X-RateLimit-Remaining | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.           |\n| X-RateLimit-Reset     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |\n\nIf you exceed the rate limit, a [429 Too Many Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) response is returned:\n\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests\nDate: Sun, 29 Nov 2020 19:21:21 GMT\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 60\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 0\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1606678044\n```\n\nWe may reduce limits to prevent abuse, or increase limits to enable high-traffic operations.\nYou can check your current limits in the [dashboard](https://app.syntage.com/settings/usage).\nTo request an increased rate limit, please [contact support](https://support.syntage.com/).\n# Pagination\nWhen issuing a GET request on a collection containing more than 1 page (e.g. [/events](#operation/ListEvent)),  a collection is returned. Links to the first, the last, previous and the next page in the collection are displayed as well as the  number of total items in the collection.\n   \nAll endpoints that support this operation have a query parameter defined by: \n  - `itemsPerPage` The number of items per page (default: 20, max: 1000)\n  - `page` The collection page number\n  \n```bash\n  \"hydra:totalItems\": 1,\n  \"hydra:view\": {\n    \"@id\": \"/events?page=1\",\n    \"@type\": \"hydra:PartialCollectionView\",\n    \"hydra:first\": \"/events?page=1\",\n    \"hydra:next\": \"/events?page=2\",\n    \"hydra:last\": \"/events?page=3\"\n  },\n```\n# Property Filtering\nThe property filter adds the possibility to select the properties for GET operations. \n  \nSyntax: `?properties[]=<property>&properties[<relation>][]=<property>`\n  \nYou can add as many properties as you need. The following example shows how to select `paymentType` and  `issuer.rfc` when fetching a list of invoices.\n  \n```curl\n  curl -i https://api.syntage.com/taxpayers/{id}/invoice?properties[]=paymentType&properties[issuer]=rfc\n```\n# API Versioning Guide\nGuidance on changes between versions.\n## Version: 2020-01-01 to 2020-06-28\n### **Invoice** \n_**Affected Endpoints:** `GET /invoices/{id}` and `GET /taxpayers/{taxpayerID}/invoices`_\n- The `amount` property has been removed from API responses. Use the `total` property instead.\n- Retrieval by invoice's `uuid` at `/invoices/{id}` is now removed. To retrieve an invoice, use the invoice's `id` at the specified endpoint. To find an invoice using its `uuid`, filter the invoice collection at `/taxpayer/{taxpayerId}/invoices?uuid[]={uuid}`.\n- Previously, the `@iri` property for an invoice pointed to the resource using `uuid`, like `/invoices/{uuid}`. Now, it points using its `id`, like `/invoices/{id}`.\n### **Link**\n_**Affected Endpoint:** `GET /links`_\n- Filtering links by `status` is removed. Use `credential.status` instead. For example, utilize `GET /links?credential.status[]=active` instead of `GET /links?status[]=active`.\n### **Tax Return** \n_**Affected Endpoints:** `GET /tax-returns/{id}` and `GET /taxpayer/{taxpayerID}/tax-returns`_\n- Retrieval by tax return's `operationNumber` at `/tax-returns/{id}` is removed. To retrieve a tax return, use the tax return's `id` at the mentioned endpoint. To find a tax return using its `operationNumber`, filter the collection at `/taxpayer/{taxpayerId}/tax-returns?operationNumber[]={operationNumber}`.\n- Previously, the `@iri` property for a tax return pointed to the resource using `operationNumber`, like `/tax-returns/{operationNumber}`. Now, it directs to its `id`, like `/tax-returns/{id}`.\n### **Event**\n_**Affected Endpoints:** `GET /events` and `GET /events/{id}`_\n- For events associated to an `tax-return`, the `@iri` property now directs to `/tax-returns/{id}` instead of the previous `/tax-returns/{operationNumber}`.\n- For events associated to an `invoice`, the `@iri` property now directs to `/invoices/{id}` instead of the previous `/invoices/{uuid}`.\n### **Extraction**\n_**Affected Endpoints:** `GET /extractions` and `GET /extractions/{id}`_\n- The `periodFrom` property has been removed. Use `options.period.from` instead.\n- The `periodTo` property has been removed. Use `options.period.to` instead.\n### **File**\n_**Affected Endpoint:** `GET /file/{id}`_\n- For files associated to an `tax-return`, the `@iri` property now directs to `/tax-returns/{id}`, instead of the previous `/tax-returns/{operationNumber}`.\n- For files associated to an `invoice`, the `@iri` property now directs to `/invoices/{id}`, instead of the previous `/invoices/{uuid}`.\n\n### Trying Out This Version\nIf you want to test this version, you can do so by making any request with the `Accept-Version` header pointing to the latest version:\n```curl\n  curl -i 'https://api.syntage.com/taxpayers/{taxpayerId}/invoices' \\\n    --header 'Accept-Version: 2020-06-28' \\\n    --header 'X-Api-Key: {apiKey}'\n```\n"

      "description": "Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` resource. For example, when a taxpayer credential is submitted, we create a `credential.created` event; and when a data extraction process finishes, we create an `extraction.updated` event. Note that many API requests may cause multiple events to be created. For example, if you submit a valid taxpayer credential, you will receive a `credential.created`, `credential.updated` and `link.created` event.\n\nEvents occur when the state of another API resource changes. The state of that resource at the time of the change is embedded in the event's data field. For example, a `credential.updated` event will contain a Credential, and an `invoice.updated` event will contain an Invoice.\n\nAs with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an individual event or a list of events from the API. We also have a separate webhooks system for sending the Event objects directly to an endpoint on your server. Webhooks are managed in your account settings.\n\nWhen using Connect, you can also receive notifications of events that occur in connected taxpayer accounts. For these events, there will be an additional taxpayer attribute in the received Event object.\n\n*NOTE: Right now, access to events is guaranteed only for 30 days.*\n### Types of events\n- **credential.created**: Occurs whenever a new taxpayer credential is submitted\n- **credential.updated**: Occurs whenever a credential status changes\n- **credential.deleted**: Occurs whenever a credential is deleted\n- **link.created**: Occurs whenever a link with a taxpayer is created\n- **link.updated**: Occurs whenever a link status changes\n- **link.deleted**: Occurs whenever a link is deleted\n- **extraction.created**: Occurs whenever a data extraction request is created\n- **extraction.updated**: Occurs whenever an extraction status changes\n- **invoice.created**: Occurs whenever a new invoice is extracted from SAT\n- **invoice.updated**: Occurs whenever an existing invoice is updated\n- **invoice.deleted**: Occurs whenever an existing invoice is deleted\n- **invoice_payment.created**: Occurs whenever a new \"invoice payment\" is created from an invoice of type payment\n- **invoice_payment.updated**: Occurs whenever an existing \"invoice payment\" is updated\n- **invoice_line_item.created**: Occurs whenever a new \"invoice line item\" is created from an invoice\n- **invoice_line_item.updated**: Occurs whenever an existing \"invoice line item\" is updated\n- **tax_return.created**: Occurs whenever a new tax return is extracted from SAT\n- **tax_return.updated**: Occurs whenever an existing tax return is updated\n- **tax_return.deleted**: Occurs whenever an existing tax return is deleted\n- **export.created**: Occurs whenever the export endpoint is requested to generate a file\n- **export.updated**: Occurs whenever the export status changes. At the beginning it is `pending`, `running` while the file is creating and `finished` when the resource is ready\n- **tax_status.created**: Occurs whenever a tax status is extracted from SAT\n- **tax_status.updated**: Occurs whenever an existing tax status is updated\n- **tax_status.deleted**: Occurs whenever an existing tax status is deleted\n- **tax_compliance_check.created**: Occurs whenever a tax compliance check is extracted from SAT\n- **tax_compliance_check.updated**: Occurs whenever an existing tax compliance check is updated\n- **tax_compliance_check.deleted**: Occurs whenever an existing tax compliance check is deleted\n- **tax_retention.created**: Occurs whenever a tax retention is extracted from SAT\n- **tax_retention.updated**: Occurs whenever an existing tax retention is updated\n- **tax_retention.deleted**: Occurs whenever an existing tax retention is deleted\n- **electronic_accounting_record.created**: Occurs whenever a electronic accounting record is extracted from the SAT\n- **electronic_accounting_record.updated**: Occurs whenever an existing electronic accounting record is updated\n- **rpc_entidade.created**: Occurs whenever a new entidade is extracted from RPC\n- **rpc_entidade.updated**: Occurs whenever an existing entidade is updated\n- **rpc_socio.created**: Occurs whenever a new socio is extracted from RPC\n- **rpc_socio.updated**: Occurs whenever an existing socio is updated\n- **rpc_acto.created**: Occurs whenever a new acto is extracted from RPC\n- **rpc_acto.updated**: Occurs whenever an existing acto is updated\n"

Syntage generates a signature using a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) with SHA-256 using the `signingSecret` as key. To verify the hash you can do the following steps:\n#### Step 1 Extract the timestamp and signature from the header\nSplit the header, using the ` , ` character as the separator. The value for the prefix `t` corresponds to the timestamp and `s` corresponds to the signature.\n#### Step 2: Prepare the signed_payload string\nThe signed_payload string is created by concatenating (without spaces):\n\n - The timestamp (as a string in Unix format) example: `\"1656569160\"`\n\n - The character `.` (dot)\n\n - The actual JSON payload (that is, the request body)\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the expected signature\nCompute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function. Use the endpoint’s signing secret as the key,  and use the signed_payload string as the message.\n#### Step 4: Compare the signatures\nCompare the signature (or signatures) in the header to the expected signature. For an equality match,  compute the difference between the current timestamp and the received timestamp,  then decide if the difference is within your tolerance.\nTo protect against timing attacks, use a constant-time string comparison to compare the expected signature to each of the received signatures.\n#### Here`s a code example using PHP with a constant-time string:\n```php\n    function splitString(string $separator, $stringValue): array\n    {\n      return explode($separator, $stringValue);\n    }\n    \n    ## X-Satws-Signature\n    $xSatSignatureHeader = 't=1656569160,s=527124c570b27b3f268777b2ba96a9bbdc4b0ecde2885f688beda528f39c4e23';\n    \n    list($timestamp, $signature) = array_map(function($signatureParam){\n    return splitString('=', $signatureParam)[1];\n    }, splitString(',', $xSatSignatureHeader));\n    \n    $bodyPayload = '{\n    \"@context\": \"/contexts/Event\",\n    \"@id\": \"/events/88a88df8-5c55-44a4-a222-ef9999c999\",\n    \"@type\": \"Event\",\n    \"id\": \"88a88df8-5c55-44a4-a222-ef9999c999\",\n    \"type\": \"credential.updated\",\n    \"source\": None,\n    \"createdAt\": \"2022-06-29 20:14:09\",\n    \"updatedAt\": \"2022-06-29 20:14:09\"\n    }';\n    $signingSecret = '320639996d9eee9178bf89d26cdbc23d';\n    \n    $hash = hash_hmac('sha256', sprintf('%d.%s', $timestamp, $bodyPayload), $signingSecret);\n    \n    print strcmp($hash, $signature);\n```\n",
